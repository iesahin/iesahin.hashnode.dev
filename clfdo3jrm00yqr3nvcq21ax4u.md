We are using a vector database for semantic search. Currently, we employ [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io) for vector search.

I noticed there is a free vector database called [qdrant](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant) (pronounced quadrant) that can replace it.

There are other options like [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) for Postgres.

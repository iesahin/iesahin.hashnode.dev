## Object-Oriented Brain Damage

So, this is the post that I’m thinking for some time. I’m still surprised that it feels like swearing in church, it shouldn’t be this hard (and this rare) to criticize object-oriented programming. What do I mean by OOP? Mainly the classical style, where you define classes with members and methods, and use this to model the solution you’re dealing. It’s supposed that this way was superior to the procedural style, where you write some procedures that modifies some global state.

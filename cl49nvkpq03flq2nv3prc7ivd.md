## Representation

The programmer at wit’s end for lack of space can often do best by disentangling himself from his code, rearing back, and contemplating his data. Representation is the essence of programming. – Mythical Man-Month As years pass with newer projects, the one thing I notice more is that data is more important than algorithms. You can alleviate bad algorithms with better algorithms during the course of project, but to fix the bad data design, a full rewrite is usually necessary.

## Anonymous functions in dart

Sometimes we need anonymous functions to use for once. Dart allows two similar syntax for writing these. First one is when there is a single expression to write. (a, b) => a + b The other is when you need to write multiple statements in an anonymous functions. (a, b) { return a + b; }
